Waste to Worth

**Introduction:**
Every year, tons of expired medicines are thrown away without a second thought. This not only harms the environment but also leads to the waste of potentially useful resources. At the same time, many medical research and training centers struggle with limited funds and materials. Our idea focuses on spreading awareness about the safe use of certain expired medicines and encouraging donations of unused medical supplies to support healthcare research and training.

**Problem Statement:**
Many people throw away expired medicines, causing both environmental harm and unnecessary waste. While some expired medicines can still be used safely for basic home remedies, most people are unaware of this. At the same time, many medical research and training centers face shortage in funding and resources. This can educate the public about safe uses of expired medicines and promotes donations to support healthcare research and training.

**Solution:**
We are developing an intelligent chatbot aimed at educating users on the safe handling and awareness of expired medicines commonly found in households. This user-friendly assistant provides guidance on whether certain medicines can still be safely utilized or must be discarded, along with proper disposal methods to ensure safety and environmental care.

Additionally, the platform enables users to donate expired medicines to authorized medical colleges and research institutions, thereby supporting pharmaceutical research and enhancing student training. This initiative not only promotes responsible medicine management but also contributes to scientific advancement and community well-being.
